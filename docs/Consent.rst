Consent to OSIsoft Applications
===============================


You have chosen to use your organization’s existing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to log in to 
OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS.) In order to proceed, you will need to complete the consent workflow. 
In this step, you will grant permissions for OSIsoft Cloud Services API to do the following: 

* Access your AAD as the signed-in user (delegated permission) 

* Sign in and read user profile (delegated permission) 

* Read directory data (application permission) 


Below are the next steps required to complete your OCS account provisioning: 

1. Use the link provided in the email to log in to the Consent Portal. Note that you will need to log in 
   as a user with the Global Administrator role on your Azure AD. 

2. Upon login, you’ll be prompted to grant consent for two applications: OSIsoft Cloud 
   Services API and **PICS Consent Application**.  

3. At the Applications page, click **Consent** under the Actions column for the 2 applications 
   highlighted in yellow, **PICS External Client Tool** and **OSIsoft Cloud Services**. Applications that 
   have been successfully consented will show as **(Already Consented)** in the Actions column and highlighted in green.  

4. Click **Next** and then **Finish** to complete the consent process. 

OCS will continue the provisioning process of your account and will notify the initial signup user 
via email once the account is ready.
