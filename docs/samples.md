The Qi Preview Samples demonstrate a few ways to interact with the Qi API. 

They cover the basics, such as:
* Connecting to the Qi Service
* Creating Qi Stream Types and instances of Qi Streams
* Sending data to, and retrieving data from your Qi Stream instances
* Performing queries against Qi Streams
* Destroying Qi Streams and Qi Types

Currently, the samples are available in these languages:
* C#
* Java
* Python

As these are for demonstration purposes, they represent some example practices. The patterns may change as the Qi Preview progresses. Be sure to follow the Qi Samples Repository for updates.

You can find the [Qi-Samples Repository](https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples) on GitHub.
