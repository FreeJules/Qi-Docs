#Qi docs overview
Qi is a cloud-based highly flexible sequential data historian that can be used to store, retrieve and analyze data. Users create and write data to streams using a simple REST API. The streams can store simple or complex data types to suit the application needs. An assortment of methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and easily obtain needed information.

Familiarization with Qi and its capabilities is easy. Introductory information such as API refernces can be found in [Getting started with Qi REST API](https://qi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Overview/) and code samples that will help get you going quicky are accessible via the <a href="https://github.com/osisoft/Qi-Samples" target="_blank">Qi-Samples</a> repository on GitHub.
Keep in mind that during the [Qi preview](https://qi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/preview/) phase the samples and documentation will change, so be sure to check back here periodically.
### Getting started
In order to use the Qi REST API in your applications, make sure you have the following requirements:

- A computer
- A set of tools that you feel comfortable using to consume and use RESTful Web Services
- If consuming the .NET Qi Client Libraries, you must be using tools capable of using the .NET 4.5.2 Runtimes in your enviroment.
- A Qi Preview Tenant and corresponding set of OAuth2 authentication keys

We then recommend continuing on to the [Getting started with Qi REST API](https://qi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Overview/) section in orer to get going.

### Using the samples
Once you've met the prerequisites, feel free to get the various Qi Preview samples.
You can find an overview of the various examples on the [Samples Page](https://qi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/samples/)
