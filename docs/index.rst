Qi is a highly flexible cloud-based sequential data historian that is
used to store, retrieve, and analyze data. You create and write data
to streams using a simple REST API. The streams are able to store simple or
complex data types to suit the application needs. An assortment of
methods with customizable behaviors are available to read data and
easily obtain needed information.
