This deployment introduces new service features requiring updates to your client side code. A summary of the new service features as well as references to the documentation to help you resume use of the service can be found below: <h2>Namespaces<\/h2> Namespaces are used to separate tenants into logical entities. The definition of types, streams and behaviors will now be defined at the Namespace level as opposed to the tenant level creating an independent list of Type, Stream and Stream Behavior nobjects for each Namespace within a tenant. It is required that you create at least one Namespace within your tenant. You can reference the Quick start section of the documentation here to create your first Namespace and begin writing to that namespace. Also, the samples within the Qi-Samples repository on GitHub have been updated to reflect the new features of the service. <h2>tenantId Parameter<\/h2> Tenant IDs will now be referenced in all Qi calls. Your tenantID for ************ is: ************ An example of the client side code changes necessary for Namespaces and the tenantID parameter using GetOrCreateType( ) is shown below: <blockquote>     <h3>Qi API<\/h3>     <code>QiType GetOrCreateType(string tenantId, string namespaceId, QiType qitype);          Task<QiType> GetOrCreateTypeAsync(string tenantId, string namespaceId, QiType qitype);<\/code>     <h3>Http<\/h3>     <code>POST Qi\/{tenantId}\/{namespaceId}\/Types<\/code> <\/blockquote>"
